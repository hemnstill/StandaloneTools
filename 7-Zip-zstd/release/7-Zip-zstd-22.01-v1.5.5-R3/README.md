# README

This is the Github Page of [7-Zip] ZS with support of additional Codecs. The library used therefore is located here: [Multithreading Library](https://github.com/mcmilk/zstdmt)

You can install it in two ways:
1. complete setup with additions within the GUI and a modified Explorer context menu
2. only the codec plugin that goes to your existing [7-Zip] installation (no GUI changes and no additional Hashers)

## Codec overview
1. [Zstandard] v1.5.5 is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder.
   - Levels: 1..22

2. [Brotli] v.1.0.9 is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.
   - Levels: 0..11

3. [LZ4] v1.9.4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core (0.16 Bytes/cycle). It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core (0.71 Bytes/cycle). A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is available, trading customizable CPU time for compression ratio.
   - Levels: 1..12

4. [LZ5] v1.5 is a modification of LZ4 which was meant for a better ratio at cost of slower compression and decompression. It's superseded by [Lizard] now.
   - Levels: 1..15

5. [Lizard] v1.0 is an efficient compressor with fast decompression. It achieves compression ratio that is comparable to zip/zlib and zstd/brotli (at low and medium compression levels) at decompression speed of 1000 MB/s and faster.
   - Levels 10..19 (fastLZ4) are designed to give about 10% better decompression speed than LZ4
   - Levels 20..29 (LIZv1) are designed to give better ratio than LZ4 keeping 75% decompression speed
   - Levels 30..39 (fastLZ4 + Huffman) adds Huffman coding to fastLZ4
   - Levels 40..49 (LIZv1 + Huffman) give the best ratio, comparable to zlib and low levels of zstd/brotli, but with a faster decompression speed

6. [Fast LZMA2] v1.0.1 is a LZMA2 compression algorithm, 20% to 100% faster than normal LZMA2 at levels 5 and above, but with a slightly lower compression ratio. It uses a parallel buffered radix matchfinder and some optimizations from Zstandard. The codec uses much less additional memory per thread than standard LZMA2.
   - Levels: 1..9

## 7-Zip Zstandard Edition (full setup, with GUI and Explorer integration)

### Installation (via setup)
1. download the setup from here [7-Zip ZS Releases](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd/releases)
2. install it, like the default [7-Zip]
3. use it ;)
4. you may check, if the [7-Zip] can deal with [Zstandard] or other codecs via this command: `7z.exe i`

The output should look like this:

### Usage and features of the full installation

- compression and decompression for [Brotli], [Lizard], [LZ4], [LZ5] and [Zstandard] within the [7-Zip] container format
- compression and decompression of [Lizard] (`.liz`), [LZ4] (`.lz4`), [LZ5] (`.lz5`) and [Zstandard] (`.zst`) files
- handling of ZIP files with [Zstandard] compression
- included [lzip] decompression support, patch from: https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/lzip/7zip/
- explorer context menu: _"Add to xy.7z"_ will use all parameters of the last "Add to Archive" compression dialog (this includes: method, level, dictionary, blocksize, threads and paramters input box)
- squashfs files with LZ4 or Zstandard compression can be handled
- several history settings aren't stored by default, look [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/discussion/45797/thread/dc2ac53d/?limit=25) for some info about that, you can restore original 7-Zip behavior via `tools->options->settings`
- these hashes can be calculated: CRC32, CRC64, MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, XXH32, XXH64, BLAKE2sp, BLAKE3 (lowercase or uppercase)

## Zstandard codec Plugin for Mainline 7-Zip

### Installation (via plugin)

1. download the `Codecs.7z` archive from here [7-Zip ZS Releases](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd/releases), this archive holds binaries, which are compatible with the Mainline version of [7-Zip]
2. create a new directory named `Codecs` and put in there the zstd-x32.dll or the zstd-x64.dll, depending on your [7-Zip] installation
   - normally, the x32 should go to: "C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip\Codecs"
   - the x64 version should go in here: "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\Codecs"
3. you could also replace the `7z.dll` directly within `C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip`
4. then you may check if the dll is correctly installed via this command: `7z.exe i`

The output should look like this:

```

### Usage (codec plugin)

- compression and decompression for [Brotli], [Fast LZMA2], [Lizard], [LZ4], [LZ5] and [Zstandard] within the 7-Zip container format
- you can only create `.7z` files, the files like `.lz4`, `.lz5` and `.zst` are not covered by the plugins
- when compressing binaries (*.exe, *.dll), you have to explicitly disable the bcj2 filter via `-m0=bcj`,
  when using only the plugin dll's
- so the usage should look like this:
```
7z a archiv.7z -m0=bcj -m1=zstd -mx1   Fast mode, with BCJ preprocessor on executables
7z a archiv.7z -m0=bcj -m1=zstd -mx..  ...
7z a archiv.7z -m0=bcj -m1=zstd -mx21  2nd Slowest Mode, with BCJ preprocessor on executables
7z a archiv.7z -m0=bcj -m1=zstd -mx22  Ultra Mode, with BCJ preprocessor on executables
7z a archiv.7z -m0=bcj -m1=brotli -mxN  ...
7z a archiv.7z -m0=bcj -m1=lizard -mxN  ...
7z a archiv.7z -m0=bcj -m1=lz4 -mxN  ...
7z a archiv.7z -m0=bcj -m1=lz5 -mxN  ...
7z a archiv.7z -m0=bcj -m1=flzma2 -mxN  ...
```

## Codec Plugin for Total Commander
- download [TotalCmd.7z]
- install it, by replacing the files `tc7z.dll` and `tc7z64.dll` with the new ones
- you can check the Total Commander Forum for more information about this [DLL Files](https://ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?p=319216)
- decompression for [Brotli], [Lizard], [LZ4], [LZ5] and [Zstandard] ot the 7-Zip `.7z` format
  will work out of the box with Total Commander now :-)

## Codec Plugin for Far Manager
- copy the `7z.dll` file from `C:\Program Files\7-Zip-Zstandard\7z.dll` to `C:\Program Files\Far Manager\Plugins\ArcLite\7z.dll`
- then restart the Far manager - and on next start, you will have support for 7-Zip Zstandard archives ;-)

## Benchmarks

For the benchmarks I am using Windows 7 64bit on my Laptop which has the following Hardware:
- Intel i7-3632QM, limited to 2,2GHz, 16GB RAM, disabled swap space
- the compression benchmark is read / written to an 4 GiB [ImDisk]
- the decompression benchmark is also done in RAM via: `7z t archiv.7z`
- the tool for measuring the times is [wtime](https://github.com/mcmilk/wtime), together with some [scripts](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-Benchmarking)
- the testfile is generated via [generate-mcorpus](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-Benchmarking/blob/master/generate-mcorpus)
- please note, that the benchmarks are outdated now (new one will come, but it needs some time)
